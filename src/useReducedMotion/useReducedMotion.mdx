# `useReducedMotion`

A hook that detects if the user has requested reduced motion on their device. This is useful for creating accessible animations that respect user preferences.

## Features

- Detects the user's motion preference via CSS media query
- Supports SSR with optional initial value
- Updates reactively when user preferences change
- Configurable with options for initialization behavior

## Parameters

- `initialValue` (optional): Default state before the media query is evaluated. Useful for SSR.
- `options` (optional): Configuration object passed to the underlying `useMediaQuery` hook

## Returns

A boolean indicating whether reduced motion is preferred (`true`) or not (`false`).

## Example Usage

```jsx
function AnimatedComponent() {
  const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();

  return (
    <div
      className={
        prefersReducedMotion ? "simple-transition" : "elaborate-animation"
      }
    >
      {prefersReducedMotion
        ? "Using simplified animation for accessibility"
        : "Using standard animation"}
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Canvas of={useReducedMotionStory.Primary} />
