# `useMounted`

Indicates whether a component has mounted to the DOM, returning `true` after mounting and `false` during the initial render.

## Features

- Detects when a component has mounted to the DOM
- Helps prevent hydration mismatches in server-side rendering contexts
- Allows for conditional rendering of client-side only content
- Zero dependencies beyond React's built-in hooks

## Returns

`boolean` - Returns `false` initially and `true` once the component has mounted.

## Example Usage

```jsx
function Example() {
  const isMounted = useMounted();

  return <div>{isMounted && <ClientOnlyComponent />}</div>;
}
```

<Canvas of={useMountedStory.Primary} />
